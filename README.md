## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb data to answer the following business questions:

1.	Seasonal variations: How price changes through the year? Are there seasonal price variations?
2.	Occupancy rates: What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
3.	Popular accommodation types: What are the accommodation options available in Seattle?
4.	Location: Are there significant price variations depending on the neighborhood? Which are the areas with the highest average prices?
5.	Predicting prices: What factors have a stronger influence on price?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps.  

There are no additional files necessary to obtain the final results and answer the proposed business questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
