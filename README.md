## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The main libraries with corresponding versions to run  the code are the following:   

Python 3.6.7 |Anaconda, Inc.|
Scikit-Learn 0.20.2
NumPy 1.15.4
SciPy 1.1.0
Pandas 0.23.4

To generate quick reports from a pandas DataFrame, the module `pandas_profiling` is used.
Module description and installation is available at: [pandas_profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb data to answer the following business questions:

1.	Seasonal variations: How price changes through the year? Are there seasonal price variations?
2.	Occupancy rates: What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
3.	Popular accommodation types: What are the accommodation options available in Seattle?
4.	Location: Are there significant price variations depending on the neighborhood? Which are the areas with the highest average prices?
5.	Predicting prices: What factors have a stronger influence on price?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final Machine learning model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
